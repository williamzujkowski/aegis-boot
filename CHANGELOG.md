# Changelog

All notable changes to aegis-boot are recorded here. Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-14

Tracks progress of the [v0.3.0 epic (#29)](https://github.com/williamzujkowski/aegis-boot/issues/29). Raises the security floor (real cryptographic authentication) and the UX floor (last-choice persistence, explicit Windows-not-bootable diagnostic).

### Landed

- **Minisign detached signature verification** (#30) — `iso-probe::verify_iso_signature` looks for `<iso>.minisig` and verifies against `AEGIS_TRUSTED_KEYS`. New `SignatureVerification` enum: `Verified` / `KeyNotTrusted` / `Forged` / `NotPresent` / `Error`. TUI Confirm screen renders the result with colored severity. **Real authentication, not just integrity** — distinct from the v0.2.0 hash check, which only proves the ISO matches its own checksum file.
- **Boot menu persistence** (#31) — last kexec choice (ISO path + cmdline override) saved to `$AEGIS_STATE_DIR/last-choice.json` (defaults to `/run/aegis-boot`). On startup, the matching ISO is pre-selected and the override is re-applied. Best-effort: missing or corrupt state is silently ignored.
- **Windows installer detection** (#32) — new `Distribution::Windows` variant + `Quirk::NotKexecBootable`. Detected from `bootmgr`, `sources/boot.wim`, `efi/microsoft/`, or `windows` path markers. Surfaces a specific diagnostic instead of falling through the generic "unsigned kernel" path that wouldn't help here.

### Deferred to v0.4.0 (documented honestly)

- **OVMF SecBoot CI verification** (#16) — needs a dedicated design doc to nail down whether to enroll a test MOK + sign our own kernel, or chain through Ubuntu's signed shim+kernel. Either approach is a meaningful CI investment.
- **UDF filesystem support in iso-parser** — kernel handles UDF transparently when loop-mounting; iso-parser's path-based detection works for hybrid ISOs already. Standalone UDF (no ISO9660 cohabitation) hasn't been observed in supported distros' install media. If a real-world need surfaces, it lands then.
- **Kernel module loading in initramfs** — distro `linux-image-virtual` / `linux-image-generic` kernels compile USB xHCI, NVMe, AHCI, sd_mod, and ext4 directly in. Module-loading complexity isn't justified until we hit hardware that actually needs it.
- **TPM PCR extension** — measure ISO + cmdline into PCR 12/13 before kexec. Genuinely useful for attestation but needs `swtpm` in CI to test, which is its own setup.

### Test tally

- **v0.2.0:** 71 tests
- **v0.3.0:** 81 tests (+10)

### CI tally

11 checks per PR, all green on `main`. (The `Boot initramfs under QEMU` job briefly flaked once on PR #31 — admin-merged after 10/11 green; tracked but not blocking.)

### Upgrade notes

- `iso_probe::DiscoveredIso` gained `signature_verification: SignatureVerification` — consumers that construct the struct manually must populate it (`SignatureVerification::NotPresent` if you don't want minisign checks).
- `iso_parser::Distribution` gained `Windows` variant — `match` expressions on `Distribution` need a new arm or wildcard.
- `iso_probe::Quirk` gained `NotKexecBootable` variant — same.
- `rescue-tui` gains a `serde_json` dep (transitive: `serde`).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-14

Tracks progress of the [v0.2.0 epic (#24)](https://github.com/williamzujkowski/aegis-boot/issues/24). Closes must-haves for:

- **Structured tracing to journald** — every discover/prepare/kexec step emits a `tracing` event with stable fields. `AEGIS_LOG_JSON=1` opts into JSON format for `journalctl --output=json` triage. Default filter raised to `info` so operators see useful output without setting `RUST_LOG`.
- **TUI kernel cmdline editor** — Confirm → `e` enters an in-TUI editor; Enter commits, Esc cancels. Per-ISO override map preserved across cancel/re-enter. UTF-8 cursor walking via `String::is_char_boundary`. The override takes precedence over the ISO-declared default at kexec time.
- **ISO hash verification against sibling checksum files** — `iso-probe` looks for `<iso>.sha256` (sidecar) first, then `SHA256SUMS` in the same directory. First match wins. Confirm screen renders a colored status: green `✓ verified`, red bold `✗ MISMATCH — do NOT kexec`, or default `(no sibling checksum)`. **Not** crypto-grade signing — that's a separate follow-up. Module docstring is explicit about what hash verification buys and what it doesn't.
- **Real kexec_file_load integration test** — `kexec_loader::load_dry` exercises the real syscall against a real kernel in CI, asserting `/sys/kernel/kexec_loaded` transitions 0 → 1. First time the kexec syscall path is end-to-end-verified rather than just errno-classification-unit-tested.
- **Distribution enum extended** — Alpine / NixOS / RHEL (Rocky / AlmaLinux) promoted from `Unknown`-detected to named variants with specific detection + quirk mappings. `docs/compatibility/iso-matrix.md` updated.

### What did NOT land in 0.2.0

- **OVMF SecBoot CI verification** — deferred to v0.3.0. Requires end-to-end shim+signed-kernel+MOK plumbing that doesn't fit a small CI job cleanly; needs a dedicated design doc.
- **True crypto-grade ISO signature verification** (minisign / sigstore) — the module boundary is in place; the verifier itself is follow-up work.
- **UDF filesystem, kernel module loading, TPM PCR extension** — all should-haves / nice-to-haves in #24 that didn't fit.

### Test tally

- **v0.1.0 baseline:** 35 tests
- **v0.2.0:** 71 tests (+36)

### CI tally

11 checks per PR, all green on `main`:
Test (1.85) · Test (stable) · SAST (semgrep) · cargo-deny · gitleaks · CycloneDX SBOM · Nix smoke · reproducible-build · initramfs build · loop-mount integration · QEMU smoke boot.

### Upgrade notes

- `iso_probe::DiscoveredIso` gained a `hash_verification` field — consumers that construct the struct manually must populate it (use `HashVerification::NotPresent` if you don't want hash checks).
- `Distribution` enum added three variants (`Alpine`, `NixOS`, `RedHat`) — `match` expressions on `Distribution` must add arms or use a wildcard.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-14

First release. The rescue runtime boots end-to-end in CI: a real kernel unpacks a reproducible `initramfs.cpio.gz`, PID 1 runs, `rescue-tui` reaches first render, and the whole chain is verified on every PR.

### Architecture

- **ADR 0001** — signed Linux rescue + ratatui TUI + `kexec_file_load(2)` runtime. Decided by 5-agent consensus vote (higher-order, supermajority, 4–1) preserved in [`docs/adr/0001-runtime-architecture.md`](./docs/adr/0001-runtime-architecture.md).

### Crates

- **`iso-parser`** (existing, preserved) — ISO9660 / El Torito / UDF discovery, `cargo-fuzz`-covered.
- **`iso-probe`** (new, v0.1.0) — sync facade + RAII `PreparedIso` for kexec handoff. Real loop-mount integration test (#16).
- **`kexec-loader`** (new, v0.1.0) — audited `unsafe` FFI over `kexec_file_load(2)` only. Classifies `EKEYREJECTED` / `EPERM` / `ENOEXEC`. `kexec_load(2)` and `KEXEC_FILE_UNSAFE` deliberately not exposed.
- **`rescue-tui`** (new, v0.1.0) — ratatui binary. Pure state-machine + renderer split; stderr startup banner for serial consoles.

### Build + ship

- `Dockerfile.locked` — Ubuntu 22.04 (digest-pinned) + Rust 1.85, no EDK II (dropped per ADR 0001). `rescue-tui` binary is byte-reproducible under `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`.
- `scripts/build-initramfs.sh` — produces `out/initramfs.cpio.gz` (3.6 MB, byte-reproducible: sha256 `d82acb9e170b9750a40c23470dad45d15cd0a7cc48234f11b36e9d41a31bbb95`).
- `scripts/qemu-smoke.sh` — boots the initramfs under QEMU and asserts the TUI starts.

### CI (11 checks per PR)

Test (1.85) · Test (stable) · SAST (semgrep) · cargo-deny · gitleaks · CycloneDX SBOM · Nix smoke · reproducible-build · initramfs build · loop-mount integration · QEMU smoke boot.

### Documentation

- [`THREAT_MODEL.md`](./THREAT_MODEL.md) rewritten for the Option B chain.
- [`BUILDING.md`](./BUILDING.md) — reproducible build + initramfs assembly recipe.
- [`docs/adr/0001-runtime-architecture.md`](./docs/adr/0001-runtime-architecture.md) — decision record incl. preserved security dissent + revisit triggers.

### Known limits

- **Secure Boot chain** is demonstrated by design but not yet CI-verified. `aegis-boot` trusts shim + a distro-signed kernel; the initramfs rides that kernel's signature. Real MOK + SB enforcement verification is a separate follow-up.
- **`iso_probe::lookup_quirks()`** returns an empty list for every distribution. Real population tracked in [#6](https://github.com/williamzujkowski/aegis-boot/issues/6). Callers must not treat empty as "safe."
- **kexec handoff** is unit-tested via errno classification but not yet end-to-end exercised with a signed target ISO.
