# `aegis-boot` CLI reference

The `aegis-boot` binary is the operator-facing front end. It wraps the build/flash/inventory operations that previously required running shell scripts and `dd` by hand.

> **Looking for the authoritative flag list?** See [`reference/CLI_SYNOPSIS.md`](./reference/CLI_SYNOPSIS.md) — an auto-generated file that captures the exact `--help` output of every subcommand. It's drift-checked against the binary in CI (Phase 3b of [#286](https://github.com/williamzujkowski/aegis-boot/issues/286)). This document is the prose companion: examples, exit-code meanings, and "why this flag exists" context that the `--help` output doesn't cover.

```
aegis-boot — Signed boot. Any ISO. Your keys.

USAGE:
  aegis-boot init [device]      One-command rescue stick (flash + fetch + add)

```

All subcommands accept `--help` / `-h` for per-command usage.

### `--json` mode (scripting)

The read-mostly subcommands emit a stable machine-readable document when given `--json`:

| Command             | What you get                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `doctor --json`     | Health rows + score + band + `next_action`                                   |
| `list --json`       | ISO inventory + per-file sha256 verdict + sidecar coverage                   |
| `attest list --json`| All recorded attestation manifests + summary                                 |
| `attest show --json`| Raw manifest verbatim (bit-for-bit reproduction of the on-disk file)         |
| `verify --json`     | Per-ISO verification results (Verified / Mismatch / Unreadable / NotPresent) |
| `recommend --json`  | Full catalog (or single entry with `recommend --json <slug>`)                |
| `update --json`     | Eligibility envelope + host-chain (sha256 per slot) or reason-for-ineligible |
| `compat --json`     | Compat DB entries (or single entry with `compat --json <query>`)             |
| `--version --json`  | `{ schema_version, tool, version }` — scriptable semver lookup               |

Every `--json` output carries `schema_version: 1` at the root so downstream tooling can detect future breaking changes.

The implementation lives in [`crates/aegis-cli`](../crates/aegis-cli) (binary name `aegis-boot`).

## `aegis-boot init`

One-command rescue stick. Composes `doctor → flash → fetch + add` in sequence using a named **profile** — a constant bundle of catalog slugs. The simplest path from empty stick to rescue-ready, producing a single attestation manifest that spans the entire run.

### Usage

```bash
aegis-boot init                         # auto-detect drive, panic-room profile
aegis-boot init /dev/sdc                # explicit device
aegis-boot init /dev/sdc --yes          # unattended (skips prompts)
aegis-boot init --profile panic-room    # explicit profile (same default)
aegis-boot init --help
```

### Options

| Flag               | Effect                                                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--profile <name>` | Profile to install (default: `panic-room`)                                |
| `--yes`, `-y`      | Skip interactive confirmations; destructive (overrides doctor BROKEN too) |
| `--no-doctor`      | Skip the `doctor` preflight check (not recommended)                       |
| `--no-gpg`         | Skip GPG signature verification on fetched ISOs (not recommended)         |

### What it does

1. **Doctor preflight.** Runs `aegis-boot doctor --stick <device>`. Exits if the score falls into BROKEN (any `FAIL` check) unless `--yes` is passed.
2. **Flash.** Runs `aegis-boot flash <device> --yes` — wipes, writes the signed boot image, and records a new attestation manifest.
3. **Fetch + add each ISO** in the profile. Each `fetch` is idempotent via the `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/aegis-boot/<slug>/` cache, and each `add` appends an `IsoRecord` to the single attestation manifest from step 2.

If any step fails, `init` stops immediately and prints a context line. Re-running picks up where it left off (fetch is cached; flash and add are idempotent on the same stick).

### Profiles

| Name         | ISOs (count) | Size (approx.) | Purpose                                                         |
| ------------ | ------------ | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `panic-room` | 3            | ~5 GiB         | Emergency recovery kit (default)                                |
| `minimal`    | 1            | ~200 MiB       | Fastest — Alpine only                                           |
| `server`     | 3            | ~6 GiB         | Enterprise server rescue (RHEL family + Ubuntu Server)          |

**`panic-room`** contains:

- `alpine-3.20-standard` — 200 MiB, minimal, fast boot for basic rescue
- `ubuntu-24.04-live-server` — 3 GiB, familiar tooling, server-class rescue
- `rocky-9-minimal` — 2 GiB, enterprise RHEL-family rescue

Fits on a 16 GB stick with headroom for operator-added ISOs.

**`minimal`** contains:

- `alpine-3.20-standard` — 200 MiB

Use when "I just need a known-good Linux userspace to poke at this disk" and bandwidth / time / verification overhead should all be as small as possible.

**`server`** contains:

- `ubuntu-24.04-live-server` — 3 GiB
- `rocky-9-minimal` — 2 GiB
- `almalinux-9-minimal` — 1.5 GiB

For operators whose targets are servers, not laptops. No desktop / live session. All three are RHEL-family-or-Ubuntu-family enterprise minimal installers signed by a vendor our operators trust.

### Exit codes

- `0` — stick is ready with the profile installed
- `1` — step failure (doctor, flash, fetch, or add); see preceding error
- `2` — invalid arguments or unknown profile

### Example

```bash
$ aegis-boot init /dev/sdc --yes
aegis-boot init — Emergency recovery kit — Alpine 3.20 + Ubuntu 24.04 Server + Rocky 9

Plan:
  1. doctor preflight (host + stick health)
  2. flash /dev/sdc
  3. fetch + add each ISO in the profile:
       - alpine-3.20-standard
       - ubuntu-24.04-live-server
       - rocky-9-minimal

--- doctor preflight ---
...

--- flash stick ---
...

--- alpine-3.20-standard ---
Fetching Alpine Linux 3.20 Standard into ~/.cache/aegis-boot/alpine-3.20-standard
...

=== aegis-boot init: DONE ===
Profile 'panic-room' is ready on the stick (3 ISO(s) added).

Next steps:
  1. Eject: sudo sync && sudo eject /dev/sdX
  2. Boot the target machine (UEFI boot menu → USB entry).
  3. In rescue-tui, pick an ISO and press Enter.

Inspect attestation: aegis-boot list
```

## `aegis-boot flash`

Writes a freshly built `aegis-boot.img` to a USB stick.

### Usage

```bash
sudo aegis-boot flash             # auto-detect removable drives
sudo aegis-boot flash /dev/sdc    # explicit device
sudo aegis-boot flash --help
```

### What it does

1. **Drive detection** — scans `/sys/block/sd*` for devices with `removable=1`. Skips NVMe, loop, and any system drive that isn't flagged removable. Reads model + size from sysfs.
2. **Selection prompt** — shows numbered list, asks `[Y/n]` if exactly one drive, `[1-N]` otherwise. Pressing Enter on the single-drive prompt accepts.
3. **Typed confirmation** — requires you to type the literal string `flash`. `y`, `yes`, `Y` are *not* accepted. This is intentional friction because `dd` to the wrong device destroys it.
4. **Build** — invokes `scripts/mkusb.sh` with `OUT_DIR=<repo>/out` and `DISK_SIZE_MB=<full stick capacity>`.
5. **Write** — invokes `sudo dd if=out/aegis-boot.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M oflag=direct conv=fsync status=progress`.
6. **Sync + partprobe** — flushes caches, asks the kernel to re-read the partition table.

### Exit codes

- `0` — success
- `1` — drive not found, build failed, or `dd` failed
- `2` — usage error (unknown subcommand)

### Requirements

- Repo root present (the binary `find_repo_root()`s for `Cargo.toml + crates/`). For now the CLI assumes the repo is on disk; standalone packaging is tracked separately.
- `bash`, `sudo`, `dd`, `partprobe`, plus all the build prereqs in [BUILDING.md](../BUILDING.md).

---

## `aegis-boot list`

Inventories ISOs on the stick.

### Usage

```bash
aegis-boot list                       # auto-find mounted AEGIS_ISOS
aegis-boot list /dev/sdc              # mount partition 2 of device, list, unmount
aegis-boot list /mnt/aegis-isos       # use existing mount path
aegis-boot list --help
```

### What it does

1. **Mount resolution** — see [Mount resolution rules](#mount-resolution-rules) below.
2. **Scan** — reads the mount directory, separates `.iso` files (case-insensitive on the extension) from sidecars.
3. **Pair** — for each ISO, checks for sibling `<iso>.sha256` / `<iso>.SHA256SUMS` (either counts) and `<iso>.minisig`.
4. **Print** — table with `[✓ sha256] [✓ minisig]  size  name` rows, sorted by name.

If the CLI mounted the partition itself (`temporary: true`), it unmounts on exit.

### Output sample

```
Attestation:
  flashed   : 2026-04-16T13:30:00Z by william
  ISOs added: 1 recorded since flash
  manifest  : /home/william/.local/share/aegis-boot/attestations/e1ae0864-...-2026-04-16T13-30-00Z.json

ISOs on /mnt/aegis-isos:

  [✓ sha256] [✓ minisig]    1.6 GiB  ubuntu-24.04.2-live-server-amd64.iso
  [  sha256] [  minisig]    198 MiB  alpine-3.20.3-x86_64.iso

2 ISO(s) total. Legend:
  ✓ sha256   sibling <iso>.sha256 present
  ✓ minisig  sibling <iso>.minisig present
  (missing sidecars mean the ISO will show GRAY verdict in rescue-tui)
```

The attestation header is shown only when an attestation matching this stick is on disk (matched by GPT disk GUID). Silent on miss — operators may have flashed the stick on a different host.

---

## `aegis-boot add`

Copies an ISO + any sibling sidecars onto the stick.

### Usage

```bash
aegis-boot add ~/Downloads/ubuntu.iso             # auto-find mount
aegis-boot add ~/Downloads/ubuntu.iso /dev/sdc    # mount + copy + unmount
aegis-boot add ~/Downloads/ubuntu.iso /mnt/aegis-isos
aegis-boot add --help
```

### What it does

1. **Validate source** — file must exist and be readable.
2. **Mount resolution** — same rules as `list`.
3. **Free-space check** — requires `iso_size + 10 MiB headroom` available on the target. Refuses (exit 1) if not, before touching anything.
4. **Copy ISO** — `sudo cp <src> <mount>/<basename>`.
5. **Copy sidecars** — for each of `.sha256`, `.SHA256SUMS`, `.minisig`, if `<src>.<ext>` exists, copy it to `<mount>/<basename>.<ext>`. Reports the count.
6. **`sync`** — flush before the (possible) auto-unmount.

### Sidecar conventions

| Suffix | Purpose | Format |
|---|---|---|
| `<iso>.sha256` | Single-file SHA-256 checksum | `<hex>  <iso>` |
| `<iso>.SHA256SUMS` | Multi-file checksums (some distros publish this form) | `<hex>  <filename>` per line |
| `<iso>.minisig` | minisign signature | minisign format |

If no sidecar is found, the operator gets an explicit notice in the output, and `rescue-tui` will show GRAY verdict + require a typed `boot` confirmation at boot time. We never silently accept an unverified ISO.

---

## Mount resolution rules

Both `list` and `add` use the same logic to figure out where `AEGIS_ISOS` is:

| Argument given | Behavior |
|---|---|
| (none) | Read `/proc/mounts`; find a line whose mount point contains `AEGIS_ISOS`. Use that. |
| `/dev/sdX` | Use partition 2 (`/dev/sdX2`). Mount it to a tempdir under `/tmp` with `-t vfat -o rw,codepage=437,iocharset=cp437`. Unmount on exit. |
| `/some/path` (existing dir) | Use as-is. Don't mount or unmount. |
| `/some/path` (does not exist) | Error. |

Why the explicit `codepage=437,iocharset=cp437`? Because the kernel's default `iocharset=utf8` is a separate module (`nls_utf8`) that we *do* ship in the rescue initramfs but is not always loaded on the operator's host kernel. Using cp437 avoids the dependency on the workstation side. The on-stick filenames are still readable from any modern host.

---

## `aegis-boot doctor`

Diagnostic health check for both the host workstation and (optionally) an aegis-boot stick.

### Usage

```bash
aegis-boot doctor                       # auto-detect a single removable drive
aegis-boot doctor --stick /dev/sdc      # inspect a specific drive
aegis-boot doctor --json                # schema_version=1 machine-readable output
aegis-boot doctor --help
```

### What it reports

**Host checks:**
- `operating system` — Linux today (macOS/Windows tracked in [#123](https://github.com/williamzujkowski/aegis-boot/issues/123))
- `machine identity` — vendor + model + firmware read from `/sys/class/dmi/id/*` (Linux only). Informational — gives operators filing a `hardware-report` the exact strings to paste.
- `compat DB coverage` — cross-checks the DMI identity against the in-binary `COMPAT_DB`. Pass = documented, Warn = not yet in the DB with a link to the hardware-report template.
- `command: dd` / `sudo` / `sgdisk` / `lsblk` — the prerequisites for `flash` and stick inspection
- `command: curl` / `sha256sum` / `gpg` — prerequisites for `aegis-boot fetch`
- `Secure Boot (host)` — `mokutil --sb-state` first, falling back to reading `/sys/firmware/efi/efivars/SecureBoot-*` directly
- `removable USB drives` — list / count

**Stick checks (when a drive is provided or auto-detected):**
- `partition table` — runs `sgdisk -p` and verifies the GPT contains both an ESP and an `AEGIS_ISOS` partition
- `AEGIS_ISOS contents` — if mounted, counts ISOs + sidecars; warns if no sidecars present (TUI verdict will be GRAY)

### Output

```
aegis-boot doctor — host + stick health check

Host checks:
  [✓ PASS] operating system                  Linux (supported)
  [✓ PASS] machine identity                  Framework Laptop (A6) — firmware: INSYDE Corp. 03.19 (09/18/2025)
  [! WARN] compat DB coverage                not yet in compat DB — file a report at https://…/hardware-report.yml
  [✓ PASS] command: dd                       /usr/bin/dd (required to write the stick)
  [✓ PASS] command: sudo                     /usr/bin/sudo (required for dd / mount)
  [✓ PASS] command: sgdisk                   /usr/sbin/sgdisk (verifies stick partition table after flash)
  [✓ PASS] command: lsblk                    /usr/bin/lsblk (lists removable drives for `flash` auto-detect)
  [! WARN] Secure Boot (host)                disabled on this host (target machine SB state is what matters)
  [✓ PASS] removable USB drives              /dev/sda (Cruzer, 29.8 GB)

Stick checks:
  [✓ PASS] partition table: /dev/sda         GPT with ESP + AEGIS_ISOS partitions — looks like an aegis-boot stick
  [! WARN] AEGIS_ISOS contents               2 ISO(s), no sidecars — TUI will show GRAY verdict

  Health score: 93/100 (EXCELLENT)
```

### Exit codes

- `0` — healthy (PASS or only WARN items)
- `1` — at least one FAIL — the report ends with a `NEXT ACTION` line telling the operator what to do
- `2` — usage error (unknown flag etc.)

### Score weighting

PASS = 10 points / WARN = 7 points / FAIL = 0 points / SKIP = not counted. Final score is `weight * 100 / total`, rounded. Bands: 90+ EXCELLENT, 70+ OK, 40+ DEGRADED, below 40 BROKEN.

The `NEXT ACTION` line is set by the *first* FAIL row that has one — it's the single most important thing to fix before retrying.

## `aegis-boot recommend`

Browse the curated catalog of known-good ISOs that have been validated (or are vouched for by the project) under aegis-boot. Catalog entries point at the project's own canonical download URL + signed SHA256SUMS, so the trust anchor stays with the upstream project — aegis-boot just curates and helps you find the recipe.

### Usage

```bash
aegis-boot recommend                       # browse the table
aegis-boot recommend ubuntu-24.04-live-server   # show download + verify recipe
aegis-boot recommend ubuntu                # prefix match (only if unambiguous)
aegis-boot recommend --help
```

### Table view

```
Curated ISO catalog (6 entries):

  SLUG                          NAME                                       SIZE  SECURE BOOT
  ----------------------------  --------------------------------------  -------  ----------------------------
  alpine-3.20-standard          Alpine Linux 3.20 Standard              198 MiB  ✗ unsigned (MOK needed)
  archlinux-current             Arch Linux (current monthly)            1.2 GiB  ✗ unsigned (MOK needed)
  clonezilla-live-stable        Clonezilla Live (stable)                380 MiB  ✓ signed (Clonezilla / DRBL)
  ...
  ubuntu-24.04-live-server      Ubuntu Server 24.04.2 LTS               2.5 GiB  ✓ signed (Canonical CA)
  ubuntu-24.04-desktop          Ubuntu Desktop 24.04.2 LTS              5.7 GiB  ✓ signed (Canonical CA)
```

The `SECURE BOOT` column tells you whether the ISO's kernel will boot under enforcing Secure Boot without operator intervention:
- ✓ **signed** — boots; the named CA is in shim's built-in keyring
- ✗ **unsigned (MOK needed)** — boots only after the operator MOK-enrolls the distro's signing key (see [UNSIGNED_KERNEL.md](./UNSIGNED_KERNEL.md))

### Detail view (single entry)

`aegis-boot recommend <slug>` prints the project's canonical download URL, the URL of the project's signed `SHA256SUMS`, the URL of the GPG/minisign signature on `SHA256SUMS`, and a copy-pasteable recipe to download + verify + add to your stick.

For unsigned-kernel entries (Alpine / Arch / NixOS), the recipe also includes the MOK-key placement step.

### Why no SHA-256 in the catalog?

Distros release point versions on a cadence that doesn't track our commits. Pinning a hash in the catalog would make most entries wrong within weeks of every release. The catalog points at the project's *signed* SHA256SUMS instead — whoever the project trusts to sign their releases is who we trust here. The trust anchor is the project's release-signing key, not aegis-boot's catalog.

### Adding a new entry

The curation criteria + how-to-propose process are documented separately in [docs/CATALOG_POLICY.md](./CATALOG_POLICY.md). Short version: HTTPS-served canonical URL, project-published signed SHA256SUMS, real operator value, stable URL, honest SB posture.

### See also: `aegis-boot fetch <slug>`

The manual recipe (curl, gpg, sha256sum, then `aegis-boot add`) is shipped — but the next section describes `aegis-boot fetch <slug>`, which automates the same recipe end-to-end.

---

## `aegis-boot fetch`

Downloads + verifies a catalog ISO. Resolves a slug from the catalog, downloads the ISO + the project's signed `SHA256SUMS` + the GPG signature on `SHA256SUMS`, runs `sha256sum -c` against the ISO, runs `gpg --verify` on the signature, and reports the verified path.

### Usage

```bash
aegis-boot fetch ubuntu-24.04-live-server
aegis-boot fetch --out ~/Downloads alpine-3.20-standard
aegis-boot fetch --no-gpg ubuntu-24.04-live-server   # SHA-256 only (NOT recommended)
aegis-boot fetch --help
```

### What it does

1. **Slug → catalog entry**: same lookup as `recommend` (exact + unique-prefix).
2. **Download** the ISO, SHA256SUMS, and SHA256SUMS signature into a per-slug cache directory (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/aegis-boot/<slug>/` by default; `--out` overrides). Skips files already present so re-runs are cheap.
3. **SHA-256 verification**: runs `sha256sum -c <SHA256SUMS> --ignore-missing` and asserts the line for our specific ISO ends with `: OK`.
4. **GPG signature verification**: runs `gpg --verify <SHA256SUMS.sig> <SHA256SUMS>` and reports one of:
   - **OK** — signature valid against a key in your keyring
   - **Unknown key** — signature present, signer not yet trusted; gpg's full output is shown so you can decide whether to import the key. Non-fatal: `aegis-boot fetch` exits 0 because the SHA-256 itself was valid against the project-published checksum file.
   - **BAD signature** — fatal; the SHA256SUMS file appears tampered. Exit 1.
   - **gpg missing** — fatal; install hint shown. Exit 1 (or pass `--no-gpg`).
5. **Print the `aegis-boot add` line** with the absolute ISO path. Does NOT auto-add — operator may want a specific stick.

For unsigned-kernel entries (Alpine, Arch, NixOS) the success message also reminds the operator to place the distro's signing public key on the stick post-add.

### Why shell out to system tools?

`fetch` calls `curl`, `sha256sum`, and `gpg` via `Command` rather than pulling in `reqwest` + `sha2` + `gpgme` as Rust deps. Trade-offs:
- **+** Static-musl binary stays small (~855 KiB).
- **+** Trust boundary is explicit and inspectable — operators see what's invoked; `aegis-boot doctor` reports prerequisite tools.
- **−** Operators need curl + sha256sum + gpg installed (universal on Linux distros).

### Exit codes

- `0` — verified ISO ready to add (including the unknown-key GPG case)
- `1` — download / verification failed
- `2` — usage error

---

---

## `aegis-boot attest`

Attestation receipts for flashed sticks. Every `aegis-boot flash` writes a JSON manifest recording exactly what went onto the stick (image SHA-256, target device + GUID + size + model, image size) and the host environment that wrote it (operator, kernel, Secure Boot state, timestamp). Manifests live in `$XDG_DATA_HOME/aegis-boot/attestations/` (or `~/.local/share/aegis-boot/attestations/`).

### Usage

```bash
aegis-boot attest list                          # list all stored attestations
aegis-boot attest show <FILE>                   # pretty-print one
aegis-boot attest --help
```

### Why

Every other USB-imaging tool is silent after flash. The attestation receipt is the artifact that operationalizes aegis-boot's "prove what's on the stick" claim:

- **Forensics / IR** gets chain-of-custody. "What was on this stick when it was deployed?" is a cryptographic-grade question, not a vibes question.
- **Sysadmin fleets** get per-stick inventory. The manifest filename includes the disk GUID, so 200 sticks from a school-district refresh produce 200 retrievable receipts.
- **Security review** gets an audit trail. Whose user account on which workstation flashed which image with which Secure Boot state when?

    "size_bytes": 32010240000,
    "image_sha256": "abcdef...",
    "image_size_bytes": 1073741824,
    "disk_guid": "7DD588C9-3A85-48CF-822F-BFBC4D8DD784"
  },
  "isos": []
}
```

Forward-compatibility: unknown fields are tolerated by the parser. Future schema versions are additive; breaking changes bump `schema_version`.

### Cryptographic signing

v1 manifests are unsigned. The trust anchor is "you ran this command on this host, the timestamps and hashes are evidence." Cryptographic signing — TPM PCR attestation + minisign — is tracked under [epic #139](https://github.com/williamzujkowski/aegis-boot/issues/139) and will land alongside the TPM measured-boot work as additional fields, not a schema rewrite.

### What's NOT in v1 (deferred)

- **On-stick copy** at `/EFI/aegis-attestation.json`: needs an ESP-mount step after `dd`. Tracked.
- **`aegis-boot attest verify`**: depends on the signing scheme above.

### Append on `aegis-boot add`

When `aegis-boot add` succeeds, it appends an `IsoRecord` to the matching attestation:

```json
{
  "filename": "ubuntu-24.04.2-live-server-amd64.iso",
  "sha256": "abcdef...",
  "size_bytes": 2724333568,
  "sidecars": ["sha256", "minisig"],
  "added_at": "2026-04-16T13:00:00Z"
}
```

Matching logic: the destination mount path → owning device (from `/proc/mounts`) → strip partition suffix (`/dev/sdc2 → /dev/sdc`, `/dev/nvme0n1p3 → /dev/nvme0n1`) → disk GUID via `sgdisk -p` → newest manifest in the attestations dir whose filename starts with that GUID. If GUID can't be resolved, falls back to "most recent attestation overall" with a warning (correct for the common single-stick workflow; ambiguous in multi-stick sessions). Failure to update the attestation does NOT fail the add.

## `aegis-boot eject`

Safely power-off a USB stick before physical removal. Bundles the `sync + blockdev --flushbufs + udisksctl power-off / eject` recipe into one command. Pulling a stick without syncing can leave the `AEGIS_ISOS` exFAT / FAT32 / ext4 state dirty, which downstream presents as "file ends mid-ISO" on the next boot or sha256 mismatch during verification.

### Usage

```bash
aegis-boot eject                    # auto-detect removable drive
aegis-boot eject /dev/sdc           # explicit device
aegis-boot eject --help
```

### Behavior

1. **`sync`** — flush filesystem-level dirty buffers (specifically against the target device if supported, else global).
2. **`sudo -n blockdev --flushbufs`** — flush the block-device cache. Skipped with a warning if sudo is unavailable; the sync in step 1 still ran.
3. **`udisksctl power-off`** (if installed) — polkit-friendly power-off, no sudo needed. Falls back to `eject /dev/sdX` if udisksctl isn't present.

On success: "Done. Safe to remove /dev/sdX."

If step 3 fails, the stick is still synced and safe to remove — the CLI prints the manual recipe (`sudo eject` or `udisksctl power-off -b`) for the operator to finish by hand.

### Exit codes

- `0` — synced + powered-off
- `1` — could not auto power-off (stick still safe to remove — CLI prints fallback recipe)
- `2` — invalid arguments

### Why not force-unmount?

Force-unmount of a busy partition (fuser / lsof-integrated) is deliberately out of scope. If the AEGIS_ISOS partition is busy, the operator needs to know why (a file manager has it open? a background rescan?) — silently forcing the unmount would mask the cause and risk data loss.

## `aegis-boot update`

Check whether a stick is eligible for a non-destructive in-place signed-chain update. Today this is an eligibility check only — the atomic file-replace step is tracked under [#181](https://github.com/williamzujkowski/aegis-boot/issues/181).

### Usage

```bash
sudo aegis-boot update /dev/sdc        # human-readable report
sudo aegis-boot update /dev/sdc --json # schema_version=1 machine-readable
aegis-boot update --help
```

### What it reports

- **Disk GUID + attestation-manifest match.** The stick is eligible only if its GPT disk GUID is the same one recorded in the last attestation manifest — this catches case of "operator picked the wrong device."
- **Host-chain preview.** Resolves `SHIM_SRC` / `GRUB_SRC` / `KERNEL_SRC` / `INITRD_SRC` from the host (the same defaults `mkusb.sh` uses) and reports the sha256 of each slot. Operators see what *would* be replaced before opting in.
- **Ineligibility reason.** When ineligible, names the specific mismatch (device missing / no attestation / GUID differs / …).

### Exit codes

- `0` — eligible; host-chain preview printed
- `1` — ineligible; `--json` carries the exact reason
- `2` — usage error

---

## `aegis-boot verify`

Re-run sha256 verification on every ISO on the stick against its `.sha256` sidecar. Complements the TUI's per-ISO verdict column with a batch audit mode.

### Usage

```bash
aegis-boot verify                      # auto-find mounted AEGIS_ISOS
aegis-boot verify /dev/sdc             # mount partition 2, verify, unmount
aegis-boot verify /mnt/aegis-isos      # use existing mount path
aegis-boot verify --json               # schema_version=1 machine-readable
aegis-boot verify --help
```

### Verdict states

Each ISO resolves to exactly one verdict:

- **Verified** — sha256 matches a sidecar's expected value (sidecar type recorded: `.sha256`, `SHA256SUMS`, or `SHA256SUMS.gpg`)
- **Mismatch** — sha256 differs from sidecar; ISO is compromised or sidecar is stale
- **Unreadable** — sidecar exists but couldn't be parsed / ISO can't be read; operator must check the filesystem
- **NotPresent** — no sidecar at all; TUI shows GRAY verdict, operator must fetch a fresh copy

### Exit codes

- `0` — every ISO verified (including NotPresent-only)
- `1` — one or more Mismatch or Unreadable verdicts — audit trail is broken

---

## `aegis-boot compat`

Look up a machine in the in-binary hardware-compatibility database. Every row is a verified outcome filed against real hardware or the QEMU reference environment — no speculation.

### Usage

```bash
aegis-boot compat                      # full table
aegis-boot compat thinkpad             # fuzzy match vendor or model
aegis-boot compat "q35 ovmf"           # whitespace-tokenized, all tokens must match
aegis-boot compat --json               # schema_version=1 full catalog
aegis-boot compat --json thinkpad      # schema_version=1 single entry
aegis-boot compat --help
```

### Levels

- **verified** (`✓`) — full `flash → boot → kexec` chain under enforcing Secure Boot with a signed distro
- **partial** (`~`) — chain mostly works but one step has a caveat (reserved for future community reports)
- **reference** (`≡`) — virtualized (QEMU + OVMF), the CI floor — not a physical-hardware claim

### Feedback loop with `doctor`

`aegis-boot doctor` reads DMI identity from `/sys/class/dmi/id/*` and cross-checks the in-binary DB automatically. If your machine is undocumented, `doctor` will emit a WARN row with a direct link to the [hardware-report issue template](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/hardware-report.yml).

### Exit codes

- `0` — match found or full table printed
- `1` — no match for the given query (stderr prints the report-template URL)

---

## `aegis-boot fetch-image`

Download a released `aegis-boot.img` (or `aegis-boot-hybrid.iso`) from GitHub Releases, verify its minisign signature against the pinned release public key, and place it in the operator's chosen output directory. Intended for the "I just want to flash without building from source" path — paired with `aegis-boot flash <device> --image <path>` it closes the build-from-source loop for unprivileged operators.

### Usage

```bash
aegis-boot fetch-image                         # latest release, cwd output
aegis-boot fetch-image --version v0.14.1       # pin a specific release
aegis-boot fetch-image --out ~/Downloads       # override output dir
aegis-boot fetch-image --format iso            # hybrid .iso instead of .img
aegis-boot fetch-image --dry-run --json        # resolve + print plan; no download
aegis-boot fetch-image --help
```

### Behavior

- Resolves the release tag (defaults to `latest`) against `api.github.com/repos/.../releases`.
- Downloads both the artifact and its `.minisig` detached signature.
- Verifies the signature using the release pubkey bundled in the binary — a failed verification aborts with non-zero before the artifact is placed.
- On success, writes both files (asset + `.minisig`) to the output dir and prints the full local paths.

### Exit codes

- `0` — fetched + verified
- `1` — signature verification failed, or the release tag didn't expose the expected asset
- `2` — usage error (bad flag combination)

---

## `aegis-boot completions`

Emit shell completion scripts for `bash`, `zsh`, or `fish` on stdout. Pipe to the appropriate completion directory for your shell.

### Usage

```bash
aegis-boot completions bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/aegis-boot
aegis-boot completions zsh  > "${fpath[1]}/_aegis-boot"
aegis-boot completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/aegis-boot.fish
```

### Exit codes

- `0` — script emitted
- `2` — unknown or missing shell argument

---

## `aegis-boot man`

Emit the rendered man page on stdout. Mostly useful for `aegis-boot man | less` on hosts where the page hasn't been installed into `/usr/share/man`.

### Usage

```bash
aegis-boot man | less
aegis-boot man > /tmp/aegis-boot.1   # save for later viewing with `man -l`
```

The body is the same man page rendered at build time from [`man/aegis-boot.1.in`](../man/aegis-boot.1.in) with the current version + release date substituted (Phase 1b of [#286](https://github.com/williamzujkowski/aegis-boot/issues/286)).

### Exit codes

- `0` — always (the page is embedded at compile time; there is nothing to fail on)

---

## `aegis-boot tour`

Run the 30-second in-terminal product tour — a scripted walkthrough of what `init`, `flash`, `list`, and `doctor` do without actually touching a device. Intended as the "show me around" entrypoint for operators evaluating aegis-boot before committing to flashing a real stick.

### Usage

```bash
aegis-boot tour
aegis-boot tour --help
```

### Exit codes

- `0` — tour completed (or the user hit Ctrl-C cleanly)

---

## Versioning

`aegis-boot --version` reports the workspace version (currently `0.14.1`). The CLI ships in lockstep with the rest of the workspace; `cargo install --path crates/aegis-cli` (or downloading a release binary) will give you a CLI that matches the on-stick rescue-tui.

`aegis-boot --version --json` emits the same info as a stable envelope for scripted install verification or Homebrew-style version matching:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "tool": "aegis-boot",
  "version": "0.14.1"
}
```

The wire shape is defined by [`aegis-wire-formats::Version`](../crates/aegis-wire-formats/src/lib.rs) and pinned via JSON Schema at [`reference/schemas/aegis-boot-version.schema.json`](./reference/schemas/aegis-boot-version.schema.json) (Phase 4b-1 of [#286](https://github.com/williamzujkowski/aegis-boot/issues/286)). Scripted consumers that parsed the previous single-line output with a JSON library see no shape change — only whitespace differs.
